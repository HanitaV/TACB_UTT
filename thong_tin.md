A memory palace is a way to remember things by closing your eyes and trying to see them in your mind.

    *   *Step 2:* "Select the information that you need to remember. Close your eyes and think about the first place or object in your room. Add a piece of information to the object. For example, to remember birthdays, you could add three candles to show the 3rd or a calendar with July."
    *   *Step 3:* "Move to the next object in your memory palace to add the next piece of information. For example, another birthday."
