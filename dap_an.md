**3 Model answer:**
Five years ago, my brother and I decided to go on a camping holiday. I have such good memories of the time we had!
The campsite was a wonderful place. It was near a forest and it was a very beautiful place. The campsite was quite small, so there weren't many people there and it was very quiet and relaxing.
My favourite thing about the holiday was visiting the local area. The area had a lot of wonderful walks in the countryside, so we went on a long walk every day. In the evenings, we cooked dinner at the campsite and ate our food under the stars. It was wonderful.
I would love to go back there again because it is such a special place.
