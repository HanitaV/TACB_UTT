(Sept 9th 08:20)\n\n**Maria:** My name is Maria and I'm a hotel manager. I'm from Brazil, but I live in Scotland. I'm doing this course because my daughter and I love cooking. We're doing it together, I suppose! Her name is Sophia. She's eight, has lots of energy and makes me laugh. She loves playing football, and baking cakes and biscuits. I love meeting new people, listening to music and spending time with Sophia.\n\n**Derek:** I'm Derek. I live in Rincon del Mar, Colombia and I'm retired. I'm not working any more. My job is to relax and enjoy myself. I love cooking, dancing and keeping fit. I live near a beach and I often go running, swimming or sailing there. I have a big family. At the weekend, I always cook a big dinner for them. I like seeing them smile. I'm doing this course because I'm looking for new ideas!\n\n**Anh:** I'm Anh and I'm a nurse. I live in Hue, in Vietnam. I live with my parents and my grandparents. My hobbies are reading, drawing and talking to my friends online. My favourite food is beef Pho. It's a Vietnamese noodle dish. It's delicious. On holidays, I like to visit different cities. I love shopping, especially for shoes! Bangkok is my favourite city for shopping! I can't cook, but I want to do this course to learn!\n\n**Anusha:** I'm Anusha and I love climbing. I try to climb every day to stay strong. I really enjoy climbing because I can do it with my friends. After climbing, we go to a café for coffee or to the cinema. I'm a student in Singapore at the moment, but I'm from Malaysia. I'm studying computer science. In the future, I want to make my own social media website or app. But for now, I need to learn how to cook!",

A memory palace is a way to remember things by closing your eyes and trying to see them in your mind.\n\nAnthony Metivier, a memory palace expert and trainer, uses this method to remember almost everything. He has lots of books and videos about it.\n\n**Step 1:** Choose a place that you know well, for example, your bedroom. Imagine that you're in that place. Walk around and stop at important places and objects. This helps you to see the room clearly.\n\n**Step 2:** Select the information that you need to remember. Close your eyes and think about the first place or object in your room. Add a piece of information to the object. For example, to remember birthdays, you could add three candles to show the 3rd or a calendar with July.\n\n**Step 3:** Move to the next object in your memory palace to add the next piece of information. For example, another birthday.\n\n**Step 4:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you add everything you need to remember.\n\n**Step 5:** Draw a picture of your memory palace or write a description of it.\n\n**Step 6:** Visit your memory palace often.\n\n**Step 7:** Make another memory palace for other information that you need to remember.",

I read a little more and found that there are eight billion people on the planet, but about 700 million are hungry... This is what I found.\n\nSadly, much of the food we don't eat goes in the bin, then on to a rubbish dump. The UN Environment Programme found that this happens to 900 million tonnes of food each year; that's 23 million lorries of food!\n\nI did find a few good news stories, though. In some places, companies use food waste to feed animals, make electricity or power cars. I didn't know until now that one large burger restaurant actually uses their old oil, not petrol, in their lorries!\n\nSometimes, these big world problems make you feel like there's nothing you can do... One of the easiest things I found was an app that tells you about free food in the local area...",
